# Debug & Local Development Guide

## Prerequisites

- Windows with the .NET 10 SDK specified by `global.json`.
- Docker Desktop with its Linux container engine running. AppHost provisions PostgreSQL through Docker, so the complete application cannot start when the Docker engine is unavailable.
- An OpenAI-compatible model endpoint for AI features.
- Windows Professional, Enterprise, or Education with hardware virtualization for local untrusted-agent execution. The browser onboarding flow guides Hyper-V and RuntimeHost preparation.

Docker runs trusted development infrastructure. It is not the isolation boundary for imported or marketplace agents; those agents remain disabled until the certified hardware-isolation provider is ready.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Aspire AppHost (Recommended)

For the most guided Windows experience, double-click `Start-CSweet.cmd` in the repository root. It checks the .NET SDK and Docker engine, attempts to start Docker Desktop when it is installed but stopped, waits for the engine, and then starts AppHost.

Run `CSweet.AppHost` to start all services together with the Aspire dashboard.

**In VS Code:**
1. Set startup project: Right-click `src/CSweet.AppHost` → "Set as Startup Project" (or use `.vscode/launch.json`)
2. Press F5 or click Run → Start Debugging

**From terminal:**
```powershell
dotnet run --project src/CSweet.AppHost
```

This will:
- Build and start `CSweet.Api` on a random port
- Build and start `CSweet.App` (Blazor frontend) on a random port
- Build and start `CSweet.WorkerHost` as a background service
- Build and start `CSweet.AgentHost` as an unprivileged project process that applies policy and brokers approved agent operations
- Provision PostgreSQL as trusted infrastructure through Docker Desktop
- Open the Aspire dashboard automatically (shows all services, health status, logs)

The Aspire dashboard URL appears in the console output (typically `https://localhost:15887`).
Docker Desktop must be running because PostgreSQL is a required AppHost resource. AgentHost no longer launches untrusted agents as Docker containers. On Windows, untrusted execution uses the separately installed RuntimeHost service and a certified Hyper-V guest.

### Option 2: Individual Projects

Run any project independently for focused debugging.

```powershell
# API only (health endpoint on default port)
dotnet run --project src/CSweet.Api

# Blazor frontend only
dotnet run --project src/CSweet.App

# Worker background service only
dotnet run --project src/CSweet.WorkerHost
```

## External Services and Host Features

| Capability | Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Complete application startup | Docker Desktop and its Linux container engine | AppHost provisions the required PostgreSQL database as a container |
| AI features | OpenAI-compatible model endpoint | LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, or a compatible hosted provider |
| Local untrusted agents on Windows | Hyper-V, RuntimeHost, signed guest image, and current certification | Prepared through the guided Agent Isolation onboarding flow; never replaced by Docker |

## Verifying Your Setup

### Health Endpoints

After starting the API project, verify it's running:

```powershell
# Check custom health endpoint
curl http://localhost:<port>/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","service":"CSweet.Api"}

# Check built-in health check (from ServiceDefaults)
curl http://localhost:<port>/health
```

### Blazor App

After starting the App project, open the URL shown in the console (typically `https://localhost:<port>`) and verify:
- C-Sweet branding is visible
- Environment label shows "Development" or "Production"
- API connectivity badge shows Connected/Disconnected based on `/api/health` availability

## VS Code Launch Configuration

For a complete debug experience, create `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": ".NET Core Attach (AppHost)",
            "type": "coreclr",
            "request": "attach",
            "processId": "${command:pickRemoteProcess}"
        },
        {
            "name": ".NET Core Launch (CSweet.Api)",
            "type": "coreclr",
            "request": "launch",
            "preLaunchTask": "build",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/CSweet.Api/bin/Debug/net10.0/CSweet.Api.dll",
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/src/CSweet.Api",
            "console": "internalConsole"
        },
        {
            "name": ".NET Core Launch (CSweet.App)",
            "type": "coreclr",
            "request": "launch",
            "preLaunchTask": "build",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/CSweet.App/bin/Debug/net10.0/CSweet.App.dll",
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/src/CSweet.App",
            "console": "internalConsole"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Engine Is Unavailable

Run:

```powershell
docker info
```

The command must succeed before AppHost starts. If it does not:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Ensure Docker Desktop is using Linux containers.
3. Wait until Docker Desktop reports that the engine is running.
4. Run `Start-CSweet.cmd` or start AppHost again.

If `docker` is not recognized, install Docker Desktop using the link in the root README, then reopen the terminal so its PATH is refreshed.

### Aspire Postgres Authentication

Aspire uses Postgres credentials from `src/CSweet.AppHost/appsettings.Development.json`:

```text
CSweet:Postgres:UserName
CSweet:Postgres:Password
CSweet:Postgres:Database
```

If Postgres logs `password authentication failed` after credential changes, the existing Docker volume was likely initialized with older credentials. Delete the Aspire development volume once:

```powershell
docker volume rm csweet-aspire-postgres
```

After that, rerun AppHost. The volume should not need to be deleted again unless the configured credentials change.

### Port Already in Use
Aspire assigns random ports by default. If you need fixed ports, update the AppHost `Program.cs` with `.WithExternalHttpPorts()`.

### Aspire Dashboard Not Opening
The dashboard URL is printed to the console. Look for a line like:
```
Now listening on: https://localhost:15887
```

### "Unable to Connect" in Blazor App
When running `CSweet.App` standalone (without AppHost), the app tries to call `/api/health` relative to its own base URI. Since no API is running there, it shows "Disconnected". This is expected — run via AppHost for full connectivity.
